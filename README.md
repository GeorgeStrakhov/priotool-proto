# PRIOTOOL
Prioritize lists together in real time.

## How it works:
1. You create a new list (item names - item descriptions)
2. You choose prioritization criteria
3. You launch the voting, which gives you a secure unique link to share with your collaborators
4. Your collaborators go to the link on any device
5. They put their name in and start rating items one by one
6. You see results in real time on your screen
